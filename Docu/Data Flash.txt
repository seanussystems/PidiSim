Data interpretation
-------------------

All diving and setting parameters are stored in the flash memory as Word (2 bytes). This requires rounding for some data (e.g. tissue saturation from Real -> Word) and data reduction for others (e.g. DesatTime sec -> min).
Negative values will have a fixed amount added to them to get into the positive number range (e.g. AirTemperature + KOFFSET). Where no data loss is acceptable, 2 Words (4 bytes) are used for storage (e.g. StartTime divided into LoWord and HiWord). The conversion is then done like this:

  Long = LoWord + HiWord * HIGHWORD (const HIGHWORD = 65'536)

In the flash memory (and also in external binary files) the lower byte (LoByte) is always at the lower address (LSB first) followed by the higher byte (HiByte=MSB). The conversion is done like this:

  Word = LoByte + HiByte * HIGHBYTE (const HIGHBYTE = 256)


Example: Flash: 5203 => LoByte = 52h = 245 * 1 = 245
                         HiByte = 03h = 3 * 256 = 768
                                                   ----
                         Value (word) = 1013


Flash Memory
------------

All flash sectors not occupied by program code are available to the application as non-volatile data memory. 

TODO - Bitmaps (Windows, Fonts, Symbols) occupy the 1st sector of the user data area.

Dive and setting parameters are stored in data blocks of 32 bytes in the flash and can be read out and displayed later or uploaded via the serial communication interface.

Writing and reading is done word by word. Erasing can only be done sector by sector and takes a few seconds. During the deletion process all activities are frozen. 

A deleted flash sector contains only bytes with the value 0FFh (255). During writing only bits with the value 0 are written. Bits with the value 1 remain unchanged. Bits with the value 0 can never be written to 1 in the flash memory. To do this, the relevant sector must first be deleted (set all bits = 1 / bytes = 0FFh).
	
Access to the flash memory is exclusively via the MEM functions in the SYS.INC. module.

TODO: InitMem ensures that at least 2 sectors are always free! 


Dive Data Organization
----------------------

During a dive, dive data is written into the flash memory every 10-20s.

   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   |P00|P01|P02|P03|P04|P05|P06|P07|P08|P09|P10|P11|P12|P13|P14|P15|
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   1 Block = 16 Words = 32 Bytes

The first word (P00) is the log block identifier (LogIdent) and is composed of the log type (LogType) and the daily dive counter (DiveNum): 

   LogIdent = LogType + DiveNum * HIGHBYTE

The LogType is unique and identifies the type of data in the block: 

  LOGBAD     = 0   // bad (unusable) block
  LOGSTART   = 1   // pre dive parameter
  LOGINIT    = 2   // initial dive point
  LOGMAJOR   = 3   // major dive parameter
  LOGSATFAST = 4   // fast saturation parameter
  LOGMINOR   = 5   // minor dive parameter
  LOGSATSLOW = 6   // slow saturation parameter
  reserved 7..9    // reserved for future use
  LOGEND     = 10  // post dive parameter
  LOGSET     = 13  // setting parameter
  LOGERRORS  = 14  // system error and status
  LOGFREE    = 15  // free (usable) block

Setting parameters Saving and Loading
-------------------------------------

Setting parameters (Settings) are stored in the flash memory after each change and read out at boot time.

Setting parameters are stored as Word in the Flash. The organization and the save/load procedure is the same as for the dive data.

The global data (DiveAge=Word) and not the GlobalSet values (Byte) are stored.

Setting parameters can be before, between and after dive data. 

Like LoadDiveList LoadGlobalPar searches the flash for the last entry and loads it when starting.
